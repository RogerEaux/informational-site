# Project - Basic Informational Site

This project is an informational site containing 4 pages: index, about, contact-me and 404. This project was created as a practice on Node fundamentals such as file system, HTTP requests and responses, URL routing and events.

Additionally this project includes an alternative setup, on a different branch, where the same app is created but using the Express framework.
